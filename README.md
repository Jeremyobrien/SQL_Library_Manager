# SQL Library Manager
 
An application for libraries to help them manage their collection of books. The librarian has been using a simple SQLite database and has been entering data manually. This application provides a more intuitive way to manage the library's collection of books.

This project includes pages to list, add, update, and delete books. It implements a dynamic website using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Pug, SQLite and the SQL ORM Sequelize.

Creating this project was a great opportunity to start familiarizing myself with the work of implementing and utilizing a database for data persistence, as well as leveraging helpful database related tools to view and interact with database.
